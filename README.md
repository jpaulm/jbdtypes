The `jar` fle may not be all that useful, as this code should be regarded more as a framework, and the useer may very well have to add methods as s/he developes his/her project.  Look at https://github.com/jpaulm/jbdtypes/tree/master/src/main/java/com/jpaulmorrison/sample to get a flavour for how these methods are to be used.
